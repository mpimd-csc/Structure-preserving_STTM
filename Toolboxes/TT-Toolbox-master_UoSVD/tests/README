These .mat files contain matrices and right-hand sides
for the examples from the article 

S. V. Dolgov and I. V. Oseledets
``Solution of linear systems and matrix inversion in the TT-format''
Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Sciences Preprint 2011/19
submitted to SISC.

Each file correspond to a particular example in the paper.
Each file contains:
Matrix of the system A as a TT-matrix
Right-hand side RHS as a TT-tensor
Computed approximate solution X also as the TT-tensor

You can check that AX = RHS
by evaluating norm(A*x-rhs)/norm(rhs) (requires TT-Toolbox version >= 2.0)
